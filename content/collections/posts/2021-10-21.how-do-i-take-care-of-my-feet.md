                text: 'When you get out of the shower or after swimming, make sure to dry your feet well. Fungus likes to grow in warm, dark, moist places, so make sure to dry up the web spaces in between your toes as well! This will help prevent your web spaces from becoming macerated (fancy doctor terminology referring to skin becoming too wet, which can lead to skin breaking down) and help prevent athlete’s feet.'

Therefore, stretch your calf muscles as often as possible to help prevent foot and ankle pain. One of the easiest things you can do is when you are lying in bed, point your toes towards your nose until you feel a stretch in your calf. Hold that stretch for 60 seconds. Do it as often as you can.'
