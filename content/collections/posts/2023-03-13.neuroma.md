        text: 'A neuroma is a thickening of the tissue surrounding a nerve in your foot, most commonly affecting the nerve between the third and fourth toes – a condition known as Morton’s neuroma. The culprit behind this painful condition is often attributed to the compression or irritation of the affected nerve. Tight or ill-fitting shoes, high heels, and repetitive high-impact activities are common causes of neuroma.'

        text: 'Thankfully, there are several treatment options available to help relieve the pain caused by neuromas. Resting and avoiding high-impact activities can help reduce inflammation and alleviate pain. Applying ice to the affected area can also help reduce swelling and alleviate pain. Footwear with proper arch support and a wide toe box can help take the pressure off the affected area. Custom orthotics or shoe inserts can redistribute pressure and relieve pain. In severe cases, steroid injections can be utilized to reduce inflammation or surgery to remove the affected tissue.'
