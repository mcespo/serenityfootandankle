        text: 'The foot and ankle work together to provide you with balance, stability, and propulsion. They’re essential for the various movements you make during a game – shuffling, jumping, running, and pivoting. And when your foot and ankle mechanics are in top form, you’ll be able to generate the power you need for shots like serving and groundstrokes. You can help ensure your feet and ankles are in top form by stretching out your calf muscles before each game, wearing supportive shoe gear during the game, and cooling down/resting your muscles after the game. You can also work on strengthening the muscles of your legs and feet off the court.'

When they’re functioning well, you’ll be able to reach and play shots with ease, and you’ll avoid injuries that could derail your pickleball career. These injuries can also be prevented by stretching, staying hydrated, and taking care of your feet.'
