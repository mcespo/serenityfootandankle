        text: " is when you roll or twist your ankle or your ankle “gives out” frequently. Chronic ankle instability can cause repetitive ankle sprains over your lifetime. An ankle sprain is when you tear or stretch one of your ankle ligaments. We have twelve ankle ligaments that help provide stability to the ankle joint. When you roll your ankle, you have the potential of injuring one of these ligaments. Ankle sprains are a very common injury in sports and account for 40% of all athletic injuries, especially in basketball, soccer, cross country running, dance, and ballet. This type of injury often happens during activity, when landing from a jump, running, or stepping off of a curb incorrectly. However, this can also occur when simply standing and your ankle just “gives out.” Chronic ankle instability can also affect your ability to balance.\_"
