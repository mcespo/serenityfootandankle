One day, while walking to class I had a sudden sharp pain in my big toe joint on my left foot. It literally stopped me in my tracks. The pain subsided after a few seconds, so I went on with my day and forgot about it.'

At this point in my education, I knew that the pain was because of a bunion, but I had not learned all the details about the bunion surgery or the process of surgery. I did however know that I would likely need surgery to get rid of the bunion pain.'
