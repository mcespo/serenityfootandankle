        text: "Your feet are built from many small bones, that are held together by many complex ligaments and have tendons that function to give you an arch and allow you to put all of your body weight on the tips of your toes! They are amazing little machines that can do a lot. However, they do have a tipping point.\_ When you are using your feet to accomplish intricate dances on a regular basis, those tendons and ligaments are working overtime to keep all the bones in the correct alignment and maintain the arch of your feet. This causes them to feel achy or sore after a few dance classes and over time can lead to painful callused feet.\_"
