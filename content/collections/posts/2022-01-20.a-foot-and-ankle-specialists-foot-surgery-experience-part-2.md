However, about 2 years after surgery, I noticed that my skin on my left foot was getting eczema flare up right under where my screws were. At the time, it was manageable with topical medication. So, I would just deal with it when and if it happened. At first, it was not that often at all. However, over time my flare ups became more frequent and were spreading as well. I knew that to calm down my eczema I needed to have my hardware removed."
