            text: "Posterior Tibial Tendon Dysfunction occurs when your posterior tibial tendon becomes irritated and inflamed. Your posterior tibial tendon runs along the inside of your ankle and foot to insert on the arch of your foot. Its job is to work in conjunction with other ligaments and tendons to help support the arch and keep your arch from collapsing and help the foot function while walking. When your posterior tibial tendon struggles with its job because of your lower limb biomechanics, it becomes inflamed and causes you pain. It also is unable to support your arch, resulting in flattening of your medial arch.\_"
