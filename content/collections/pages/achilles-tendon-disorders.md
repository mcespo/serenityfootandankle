        text: 'The Achilles tendon can be irritated and inflamed, leading to Achilles tendonitis. Achilles tendonitis is the acute phase of irritation and inflammation that will potentially lead to pain of the Achilles Tendon. If left untreated, this can develop into Achilles tendinosis, which is a more chronic state of inflammation and pain within the Achilles tendon. This can also lead to degeneration of the Achilles tendon that can happen on its insertion on the calcaneus or heel bone, or within the substance of the Achilles tendon body itself.'

        type: text
        text: 'Achilles tendon pathology can develop as an overuse injury which is caused by an increase in some type of repetitive activity that requires the Achilles tendon to function. For example, a sudden increase in the amount of running you are doing may lead to Achilles Tendonitis developing. This type of sudden repetitive movements put alot of stress and strain on the Achilles tendon leading to micro-injury that cannot heal itself because of continued stress being applied to the Achilles tendon. This leads to the structure of the Achilles tendon changing and leading to your pain.'
