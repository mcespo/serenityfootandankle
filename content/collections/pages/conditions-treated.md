        text: "During standing, walking, and running, the foot and ankle provide support, shock absorption, balance, and several other functions that are essential for motion. Studying the biomechanics of the lower limb has allowed Dr. Ibrahim to gain knowledge that will help her address her patient’s foot and ankle pathology and pain. She is able to do this because understanding how the lower limb functions, allows her to evaluate her patient’s lower limbs, the way they walk, and pinpoint the origin of their pain.\_"
