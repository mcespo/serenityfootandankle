            text: "There are many causes of hammertoes, however, they are usually caused by an imbalance in the muscles, tendons, and ligaments of the leg and feet. They start out as flexible deformities but can become rigid over time. Most patients find it irritating or painful when the tops of their toes rub on shoe gear. These hammertoes can also become painful themselves because of the shape of the toe changes."

            text: "A flat foot is when you lack or have a decrease in the arch of your foot. A flatfoot can affect the way weight and forces are distributed across your feet as you ambulate. Flatfeet or fallen arches can be very painful and cause a myriad of symptoms and pathologies. Some of these include but are not limited to – heel pain, posterior tibial tendonitis, peroneal tendonitis, bunions, hallux rigidus, and much more! Flatfeet can even cause knee, hip, and back pain!"

            text: "Flat feet are not the only cause of foot pain, high arches can cause pain as well! A high arch, or a cavus foot type can cause pain because body weight and forces are being distributed across the heels and balls of the feet. This is where people with high arches will have most of their pain.\_"
