        text: 'Your ankle is made up of three bones called the tibia, fibula and talus. It is also supported by a vast network of ligaments which connect bone to bone. Chronic ankle instability occurs with recurring giving way of the outer side of the ankle. This can also be known as repeatedly spraining your ankle. This can happen during activity or even just when you are standing.'

        text: "Chronic Ankle Instability usually occurs after an initial ankle sprain was not treated properly or did not heal well. When you sprain your ankle, the ligaments are stretched or torn and sometimes your proprioception is also affected. (Proprioception is your brain’s ability to know where your body is in space without looking) If the anke is not supported or treated properly after that initial sprain, the ligaments and tissue that support the ankle can heal into a stretched out position, or at an improper length. This will allow the ankle to “give out” more easily in the future because the structures that protect and hold the ankle stable are not at the correct length. Each subsequent sprain can lead to an increase in instability and increase the likelihood of developing additional ankle conditions.\_"
