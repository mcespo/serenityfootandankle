They are a great conservative treatment option for many foot and ankle pathologies."

            text: "Custom Orthotics are designed to fit your unique, individual foot shape and designed to address your particular foot or ankle condition/source of pain. Over-the-counter insoles are not made to do this. While they can provide temporary relief, they cannot provide the same quality of support a custom piece can. Custom-made orthotics are also more durable and can last years with proper maintenance."
